Once upon a time, in a small, bustling city of future tech, lived a little AI robot named RoboCoder. RoboCoder was made of shiny silver metal with glowing blue eyes and a cheerful LED smile. His square head had antennae that twinkled like fairy lights, and his arms were fitted with tiny, flexible fingers perfect for typing and holding tools.

One sunny day, while exploring the bustling home of his inventor, Dr. Spark, RoboCoder stumbled upon a glowing, holographic book titled "Learn to Code: Journey into Programming." Curious and excited, RoboCoder decided to open the book with his nimble fingers. As he flipped through the holographic pages, filled with colorful diagrams and friendly characters, an adventure began to unfold.
