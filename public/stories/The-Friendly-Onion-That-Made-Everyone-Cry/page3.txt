Ollie’s spirits lifted, and he beamed at Maria and the other villagers. Determined to show his kindness, Ollie began helping the villagers with their chores. He helped Mr. Baker plant seeds in his garden and assisted Mrs. Potter in carrying heavy water buckets.

The villagers quickly learned to work around Ollie’s teary effect. They wore special glasses when Ollie was nearby, ensuring that his presence didn’t bring unwanted tears. Despite the watery eyes, the village loved having Ollie around.

One day, the villagers decided to throw a grand feast in Ollie’s honor. They decorated the village square with colorful banners and invited all the vegetables from the garden. Ollie was the guest of honor, and the feast was filled with laughter, joy, and, of course, some happy tears.

From then on, Ollie was known as the Friendly Onion, who made everyone cry tears of joy. And Ollie? He had found the best friends he could ever ask for.
