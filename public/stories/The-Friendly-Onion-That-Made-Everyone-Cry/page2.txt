Ollie rolled into the village square, where children were playing, and shopkeepers were selling their goods. The villagers paused to look at Ollie, curious about the friendly newcomer. "Hello, everyone!" Ollie greeted with a big smile. "My name is Ollie, and I'm here to make friends!"

But soon, the villagers noticed their eyes were starting to water. Maria, a young girl with braids and a freckled face, was the first to speak. "Ollie, why do you make us cry?" she asked, wiping the tears from her cheeks.

Ollie’s round body drooped a little. "I don’t mean to make you cry," he said softly. "It’s just that being an onion, my scent can be a bit strong, and it makes people’s eyes water."

Seeing Ollie’s sad expression, Maria knelt down beside him. "It’s okay, Ollie," she said kindly. "We know you’re friendly and don’t mean to make us cry."
